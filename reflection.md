## Reflection Document

### HTML

- #### Were you able to complete the excercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

  I was able to do the lists and images on my own, but had to refer to the webdev examples for syntax and how to use the tags and which tag is which. The table made sense in my head, but I was getting thrown off by one of the examples, ended up referring to the solution. For the form, I was able to do the input's whilst refering to the form webdev example, but there were no examples on fieldset and legend for the surrounding box, so I had to refer to the solution, and ended up using how the solution structred the breaks and div's.

- #### How helpful did you find the excercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

  I think the form one was most helpful, we used div's and breaks and I got to experience inline and blocks, inputting, associating labels and radios/checkboxes. The image one is pretty straightforward, so were the lists.

- #### Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

  No, I cannot really think of anything that could have been explained later. Technically I didn't do the reading yet, and i'm sure the readings would have mentioned the fieldspan and legend.

- #### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s topic a little better?

  I think if we did a lab similar to the one page example in the webdev to get more of a feel for html and its syntax, and more practice with the many different semantics and attributes.
