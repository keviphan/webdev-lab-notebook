## Reflection Document

### HTML

- #### Were you able to complete the excercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

  I was able to do the lists and images on my own, but had to refer to the webdev examples for syntax and how to use the tags and which tag is which. The table made sense in my head, but I was getting thrown off by one of the examples, ended up referring to the solution. For the form, I was able to do the input's whilst refering to the form webdev example, but there were no examples on fieldset and legend for the surrounding box, so I had to refer to the solution, and ended up using how the solution structred the breaks and div's.

- #### How helpful did you find the excercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

  I think the form one was most helpful, we used div's and breaks and I got to experience inline and blocks, inputting, associating labels and radios/checkboxes. The image one is pretty straightforward, so were the lists.

- #### Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

  No, I cannot really think of anything that could have been explained later. Technically I didn't do the reading yet, and i'm sure the readings would have mentioned the fieldspan and legend.

- #### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

  I think if we did a lab similar to the one page example in the webdev to get more of a feel for html and its syntax, and more practice with the many different semantics and attributes.

### Accessibility

- #### Were you able to complete the excercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

  Yes I was able to complete the excercise on my own, I did use the video to check my work, I have some div's for the email and and name, and I used a button
  but added a type=submit instead of doing an input like the video.

- #### How helpful did you find the excercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

  This was only a little helpful, it feels a little redudant, as we have done the 04-form in the semantics HW1 already, and 04-form.html in lab 1 so which we've already
  had to install wave and wave check it and use the w3 validation website for checking our html.

- #### Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

  No.

- #### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

  No, there was suffient work before hand from lab1 and semantics hw1 to know how to this weeks lab.

### CSS

- #### Were you able to complete the excercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

  I was able to do 01 somewhat, but ended up refering to videos to double check my work, 02 I was also able to do, but also refered to video and saw Caterina added a hover so matched it.
  I was also able to do 03 specificity. 04,05,06 I watched the videos, I probably could have refered to notes and code_samples, but didn't as the videos with Caterina explaining probably
  saved me more time, 06 was 50 mins so I realized it was probably a lot to do on my own so just went with vids.

- #### How helpful did you find the excercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

  I think all of the excercises were helpful, gets your hands and feet wet enough with CSS.

  No.

- #### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

  No, all of the excercises were just right to get feet wet with CSS.

### Flexbox

- #### Were you able to complete the excercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

  I was able to complete the first 3 containers, only had a little hiccup with container 4. But I still watched the videos to double check my work.

- #### How helpful did you find the excercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

  I found it pretty helpful, just doing it with the boxxed numbers and no content yet is a good way to see how each of the flex elements worked.

- #### Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

  No.

- #### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

  No.

### CSS Grid

- #### Were you able to complete the excercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

  Yes, I was able to complete 01 grid on my own. 02 grid, I had to refer to the video.

### Bootstrap

  This one I just went straight to the videos, as the "syntax" since I don't really know the syntax for bootstrap, so I just followed the video.

  No.

### Javascript

- #### Were you able to complete the excercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

  I just went straight to the videos to see how Caterina does the code, I probably would have been able to complete 01/02/03 by spending
  extra time looking for methods and reviewing the slides, but I was on a time crunch so decided to refer to videos right away.

- #### How helpful did you find the excercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

  No.

### Jquery

- #### Were you able to complete the excercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

  I went straight to the videos, I know I should be trying to do these on my own at first
  but I'd rather just see how Caterina does it as how she does it is how it is used in
  industry.

- #### How helpful did you find the excercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

  Very helpful, it showed how powerful jquery is and how it simplified what we did in
  07-javascript.
